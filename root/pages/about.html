      <p>We are proud and honoured to be LA's largest flower company! We first opened our doors in 1978, and were one of the first during this time period to specialize in personalized and customizable floral arrangements. Our goal was to bring a modern twist to the floral industry. Since the infancy of our buisiness we were willing to move mountains to ensure that we delivered the floral arrangement you envisioned. With 43 years of experience we continue to raise the bar in the floral industry in order to reach petal perfection.  Florals as gifts are timeless and the ultimate expression of love and care So we will continue to be here to deliver every bouquet with love.</p>

So far we have planted 103,385 seeds! and for every arrangement purchased 150 native wildflowers will be planted in the place that you nominate. Spread Love & Plant Flowers!</p>
